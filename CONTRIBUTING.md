## New To Open Source?

Here are some resources to help you get started with open source
contributions in general:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on
  GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)

- [Set up
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)

- [GitHub
  flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)

- [Collaborating with pull
  requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Issues

The Bytewax project keeps a log of work items on GitHub in the [repo's
issues](https://github.com/bytewax/bytewax/issues).

### New Issues

If you spot a problem with Bytewax, [search if an issue already
exists](https://github.com/bytewax/bytewax/issues). If a related issue
doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue
template](https://github.com/bytewax/bytewax/issues/new/choose).

### Solve an Issue

Scan through our [existing
issues](https://github.com/bytewax/bytewax/issues) to find one that
interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as
filters. By default, we won't assign issues to any contributors that
are not maintainers. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome
to open a PR with a fix.

Important Labels:

- **Good First Issue** - These are a good entry point for contributing
  to Bytewax.

- **Help Wanted** - These are issues we are looking for the community
  to help contribute to.

## Contribution Steps

### Fork and Clone

[Fork the canonical Bytewax
repository](https://github.com/bytewax/bytewax/fork). Then clone your
fork to your local machine.

### Setup Development Environment

Follow the instructions in [Local
Development](https://docs.bytewax.io/stable/guide/contributing/local-development.html)
to setup your local development environment.

### Modify and Commit

Bytewax is a Python library backed by Rust code. The codebase is split
between Python code in
[`pysrc`](https://github.com/bytewax/bytewax/tree/main/pysrc) and Rust
code in [`src`](https://github.com/bytewax/bytewax/tree/main/src).

The Python code base contains:

- All public API interface definitions.

- Most dataflow operators.

- Most IO connectors.

The Rust code base contains:

- Core Timely runtime.

- Core Bytewax operators.

- [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs/) interface to the runtime.

- Recovery system machinery.

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Be sure to [sign your
commit](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-the-commit-signoff-policy-for-your-organization#about-commit-signoffs)
if using the command line interface.

### Using AI Tools

You may use AI tools to write code, tests, docs, commit messages and
PR descriptions. These rules apply:

- You own everything you submit. A mistake an AI tool made is your
  mistake: a wrong claim, a broken test, a made-up API or link. Read
  and understand every line before you submit it, and be ready to
  explain it in review.

- The DCO sign-off (`Signed-off-by`) is your personal certification
  that you have the right to submit the change. Add it yourself; don't
  let a tool add it for you.

- Every result you report, in a PR description, a commit message or a
  review reply, comes from runs you made: tests, reproductions,
  timings. Run each one at least five times, to rule out
  nondeterminism and machine load, and say how many runs passed. For
  timings, name the build (debug or release) and the machine.

- Naming the tool is optional but welcome. If you do, add a
  `Co-authored-by` trailer with the specific model, for example
  `Co-authored-by: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also
known as a PR.

- Submit your PR as a "draft" if it is not ready for immediate review.
  Mark it as "ready to review" when ready.

- Don't forget to [link PR to
  issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
  if you are solving one.

- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer
  edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)
  so the branch can be updated for a merge.

  Once you submit your PR, a maintainer will review your proposal. We
  may ask questions or request for additional information.

- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either
  using [suggested
  changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request)
  or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly
  through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then
  commit them to your branch.

- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as
  [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).

- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git
  tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help
  you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Merge

Congratulations 🎉🎉 The Bytewax community thanks you! ✨

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be included in the
next release 😄. A maintainer cuts new releases periodically.
