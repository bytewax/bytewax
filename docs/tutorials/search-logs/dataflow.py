"""Setup a dataflow for processing search log events using Bytewax.

This module creates and configures a Dataflow to compute the Click-Through Rate (CTR)
based on user interactions from simulated event logs. Each user's actions, such as
searches, viewing results, and clicks, are tracked and processed to calculate
metrics that could inform improvements in search functionality and user interface
design.
