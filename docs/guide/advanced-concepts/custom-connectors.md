# Custom IO Connectors

More documentation here is forthcoming.

For now look at {py:obj}`bytewax.inputs.FixedPartitionedSource` and
{py:obj}`bytewax.inputs.DynamicSource` for inputs and
{py:obj}`bytewax.outputs.FixedPartitionedSink` and
{py:obj}`bytewax.outputs.DynamicSink` for outputs for the abstract
base classes you need to implement.

Also check out some of our built-in custom connectors in
{py:obj}`bytewax.connectors` and looking at the source for how they
are implemented.
