# Analytics and Operational

Some expectations on data access and access patterns you should expect
when dealing with either analytics or operational part of the data

Main idea here is to focus on what you would expect to do with data in
each of the settings and what you would use it for (alerting on infra
vs realtime-ish product dashboards)
