# Dataflow programming

Dataflow programming is a programming paradigm where program execution is conceptualized as data flowing through a series of operations or transformations.

Here we also mention a few concepts about streaming in general. No need to go super-deep here, but everytime you want to explain something in the following examples, think if we should rather have it here instead.

I'd expect some overview of types of streaming, producer/consumer/partitions/idempotency/snapshots/delivery semantics and reference to other parts of our docs 

Basically, lay down some basics and maybe show some python code. It would be super hard to write this before examples so it should always be thought of a "place to put additional stuff to help make the example section easier to follow"
